# Getting Started with This React Native Setup Template

This project was bootstrapped with [React Native Cli](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2018/05/07/using-typescript-with-react-native#initializing), and edited by [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasser-belatreche-6b450620a/), I add different libraries that I use in every React project, like `Typescript`, `storybook`, `react-native-navigation`, and `jest`. And I structure the files.\
You can clone it and start coding your App immediately.

# First

make sure to setup your envirement for react-native app development by following the instructions in the [docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). (Stop when you get to the part '`Creating a new application`'), after that clone this repo and start your project.
